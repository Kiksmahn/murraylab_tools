    "- **2D Dilution Series in TX-TL**: Takes a Python description of two materials and their dilutions. Use this when you want to run one or more two-way dilution series in TX-TL, for instance when calibrating Mg and K salts. \n",
    "- **Association Spreadsheet**: Takes one or more spreadsheets describing the contents of an Echo source plate, plus a simple spreadsheet describing final concentrations of the materials of those source plates in each destination.

    "- **Buffer/Extract Fractions**: Default is 0.24/0.51 (typical for French Press extracts).\n",

    "Every project begins with an EchoRun object. This object holds (nearly) all of the information about an experiment, and is ultimately responsible for coordinating plates and materials, and for actually writing picklists and experimental protocols. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most EchoRun objects need a SourcePlate object. This object is responsible for keeping track of which wells have been used, and for assigning new wells on the source plate to materials that you'll want to transfer. It will try to assign wells in a way that keeps the same material in a contiguous block, buffered on either side by an empty well for ease of pipetting. SourcePlate objects are also typically associated with a .dat tracking file that lists which wells have been used on the plate. That way, you can use the same source plate over many experiments without having to manually program in which wells are forbidden. The SourcePlate object will read this file to learn what it has available to it, and will automatically write back to the same file whenever the EchoRun object controlling it writes a picklist. \n",
    "\n",
    "Materials (DNA, chemicals, water, TX-TL, etc) on a source plate are represented by EchoSourceMaterial objects. An EchoSourceMaterial has a concentration, which is always stored in nM. However, because dsDNA is usually measured in ng/uL, and dsDNA is one of the most common materials used, EchoSourceMaterials by default assume that the concentration set in their constructors is in units of ng/uL. Any EchoSourceMaterial with `length` > 0 will convert that ng/uL concentration into an internal nM concentration. Only if the length of the EchoSourceMaterial is set to 0 will it use its set concentration value directly. This convention appears in several other contexts in the echo package.\n",
    "\n",
    "An EchoSourceMaterial is always associated with a SourcePlate. The EchoSourceMaterial keeps track of how much of itself has been used, and will request that wells be allocated on the SourcePlate. \n",
    "\n",
    "To generate an Echo picklist, you will generally need to do three things:\n",
    "- Building an EchoRun object. This usually just means setting the name of a source plate tracking file\n",
    "- Describe the experiment. This almost always means one or more calls to `build_picklist_from_txtl_setup_csvs`, `build_dilution_series`, or `build_picklist_from_association_spreadsheet` from your EchoRun object. What this entails depends on your experiment; TX-TL setup with a setup spreadsheet and association file setups are almost completely defined by external files, while 2D dilution series experiments require some definition in your script. \n",
    "- Write the picklist, which is done with a call to `write_picklist` from your EchoRun object. \n",
